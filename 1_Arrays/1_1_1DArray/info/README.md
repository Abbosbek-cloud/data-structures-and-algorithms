# 1D Array in Go (Golang) - A Comprehensive Guide

Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in programming, and Go (Golang) offers a simple yet powerful way to work with them. In Go, an **array** is a collection of elements that are of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays in Go have a fixed size, and the size is part of the array's type.

In this guide, we will cover arrays in Go from the basics to advanced concepts.

## 1. What is an Array in Go?

An array in Go is a fixed-size, homogeneous data structure that stores elements of the same type. Once defined, the size of the array cannot be changed.

### Syntax

```go
var arrayName [size]dataType
```
